# Project machine learning breast cancer
## Background problem
Breast cancer is a type of cancer that occurs in women and is rare in men. It needs to be classified as malignant or benign to determine the appropriate treatment based on its type. In this project, I predict the type of breast cancer using a dataset from Scikit-Learn Breast cancer wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#breast-cancer-wisconsin-diagnostic-dataset). The goal of this project is to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign based on 30 features in the dataset. I used the Random Forest model to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign.

## Version Libraries
- pandas v1
- seaborn v1
- sklearn v1
- numpy v1

## Insight 
In this project, I have obtained several insights from my analysis :
1. This model has an accuracy of 96%, which means the model can classify breast cancer very well
2. From the 20% of data used for testing or 114 samples, the model correctly predicted 70 benign cases, 40 malignant cases, 3 malignant cases were incorrectly classified as benign, and 1 benign sample was misclassified as malignant.

## Advice
This project can still be further developed into areas related to machine learning :
1. It can be improved with a larger and more diverse dataset
2. It can be improved by using other models such as Decision Tree and SVM (Support Vector Machine)
