# Project machine learning breast cancer
## Background problem
In this project, I predict the type of breast cancer using a dataset from Scikit-Learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#breast-cancer-wisconsin-diagnostic-dataset). The goal of this project is to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign based on 30 features in the dataset.

## Version Libraries
- pandas v1

## Insight 
In this project, I have obtained several insights from my analysis :
1. This model has an accuracy of 97%, which means the model can classify breast cancer very well
2. From the 20% of data used for testing or 114 samples, the model correctly predicted 71 benign cases, 40 malignant cases, and misclassified 3 malignant cases as benign

## Advice
This project can still be further developed into areas related to machine learning :
1. It can be improved with a larger and more diverse dataset
2. It can be improved by using other models such as random forest and SVM (Support Vector Machine)
